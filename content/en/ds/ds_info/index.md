## ðŸ“˜ Introduction to Data Structure Projects
This section introduces three projects completed in the **Data Structure** course at Jeonbuk National University.  
All projects were developed around the **Binary Search Tree (BST)**, focusing on implementing the characteristics of trees and efficient search algorithms through practical coding.

<br>

## ðŸ“‚ Project List

### **Project 1 â€“ Checking Binary Search Tree Balance**
Implemented the `isBalanced()` function to determine whether a tree is balanced.  
The program calculates the height of each subtree and considers the tree balanced only if the height difference between the left and right subtrees is less than or equal to 1.

### **Project 2 â€“ Counting Paths with a Given Sum**
Counts the number of paths starting from the root where **the sum of node values equals X**.  
Implemented efficient searching using **prefix sums** and a **hash map**.

### **Project 3 â€“ Koreanâ€“English / Englishâ€“Korean Dictionary**
Built a **bidirectional dictionary (K-E, E-K)** using a binary search tree.  
Implemented insertion, search, and print functionalities based on string comparison.
