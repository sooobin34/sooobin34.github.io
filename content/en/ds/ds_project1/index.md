## üéØ Project Overview
This project implements the insertion and deletion operations of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** and defines the `isBalanced()` function to determine whether the tree is balanced.  
A balanced tree is defined as one where **the height difference between the left and right subtrees is no more than 1**, and both subtrees themselves are balanced.

<br>

## üìÑ Project Report  
For a detailed implementation process, refer to the [report](/files/ds_project123_report.pdf).

<br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Features & Structure
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `getHeight()` | Recursively calculates the height of the subtree for a given node |
| `isBalanced()` | Compares the height difference between the left and right subtrees to determine balance |
| `insertNode()` | Inserts a key value following BST rules |
| `deleteNode()` | Maintains tree structure after deletion using the successor node (`findMin`) |
| `findMin()` | Returns the node with the smallest value in the right subtree |

<br>

## üß† Algorithm Summary
- **Balance Conditions:**  
  1. The left subtree is balanced  
  2. The right subtree is balanced  
  3. The height difference between the two subtrees is ‚â§ 1  
- **Traversal Method:** Recursive traversal  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) (visits every node to compute height)

<br>

## üß© Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++  
- **Data Structure:** Binary Search Tree  
- **Core Functions:** Recursive height calculation and balance checking  
- **I/O Method:** Standard input (`scanf`) and standard output (`printf`)  

<br>

## üí° Key Learnings
- Gained an understanding of how to check tree height and balance simultaneously using recursion.  
- Implementing insertion and deletion operations helped me grasp the importance of **node linkage and pointer management** in tree structures.  
- Built a conceptual foundation for **self-balancing trees** such as AVL and Red-Black Trees.  

<br>

## üìò Conclusion
Through this project, I practiced the **concept of tree balance and recursive problem-solving techniques**.  
By implementing an algorithm that evaluates structural stability beyond basic insertion and deletion,  
I developed a clearer understanding of how theoretical data structure concepts translate into practical code.
