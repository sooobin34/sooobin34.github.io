## üéØ Project Overview
This project is based on a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** and implements a program that **counts all paths starting from the root whose node values sum to X**.  

By traversing each node, the program keeps track of the cumulative sum at each step and uses an **`unordered_map`** to efficiently calculate the number of paths where the same sum occurs.

## üìÑ Project Report  
For detailed design steps and execution results, refer to the [report](/files/ds_project123_report.pdf).

<br>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Features & Structure
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `insertNode()` | Inserts a given key following BST rules |
| `deleteNode()` | Maintains tree structure after deletion using the successor node (`findMin`) |
| `countPathsWithSum()` | Recursively counts all paths whose cumulative sum equals X |
| `findMin()` | Returns the node with the smallest value in the right subtree |
| `unordered_map` | Stores frequency of path sums to avoid redundant calculations |

<br>

## üß† Algorithm Summary
- **Traversal Method:** DFS (Depth-First Search)  
- **Core Idea:**  
  - Calculate cumulative sums for all paths starting from the root  
  - Check in the hash map whether `(currentSum - targetSum)` has appeared before  
  - Efficiently count overlapping paths without redundancy  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) (due to the hash map for storing path sums)

<br>

## üß© Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++  
- **Data Structure:** Binary Search Tree  
- **Algorithm:** DFS + Prefix Sum + Hash Map  
- **I/O Method:** Standard input (`scanf`) / Standard output (`printf`)  

<br>

## üí° Key Learnings
- Understood the relationship between **recursive traversal and cumulative sum computation** in a Binary Search Tree.  
- Learned how to apply **hash maps for tracking cumulative sums** when solving path sum problems.  
- Realized the importance of balancing **time and space efficiency** during tree traversal and problem-solving.  

<br>

## üìò Conclusion
Through this project, I learned how to combine **prefix sums** and **DFS traversal techniques** to efficiently solve problems beyond basic Binary Search Tree operations.
