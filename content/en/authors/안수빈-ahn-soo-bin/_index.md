I am a **3rd-year student** majoring in **Computer and Artificial Intelligence** at Jeonbuk National University. Among various courses, I found **Database Systems, Operating Systems, and Computer Architecture** particularly fascinating.  
Through these subjects, I developed a strong interest in the internal structure of computer systems and efficient data management, which has led me to explore the field of **Cloud Computing** in more depth.

My goal is to develop **practical and user-friendly applications** or contribute to improving the **stability and efficiency of cloud-based services**.  
To achieve this, I am preparing for the **Information Processing Engineer certification** and improving my English proficiency through TOEIC, while continuously enhancing both my technical and communication skills.  
I enjoy learning new technologies and aspire to become a **dedicated developer who keeps growing and taking on new challenges**.
