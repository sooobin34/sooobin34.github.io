## 🎮 Project Overview
This project is a **runner-style jump game** developed using **Pygame**.  
The player jumps with the spacebar to avoid obstacles (penguins),  
earning points each time an obstacle is successfully avoided—similar to **Cookie Run**.  
After the game ends, the player’s score and survival time are displayed,  
and pressing the spacebar restarts the game.

## ⚙️ Main Features
| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Jump Physics** | Implemented smooth jump motion using gravity and peak height calculation |
| **Random Obstacle Generation** | Penguins appear at random intervals and distances over time |
| **Collision Detection** | Detects overlap between character and obstacle and triggers Game Over immediately |
| **Scoring System** | Score increases each time an obstacle is avoided |
| **Restart Function** | Press the spacebar to restart the game after it ends |

## 📈 Results
- Players earn points by jumping over obstacles  
- Difficulty gradually increases as survival time grows  
- Fully supports score display, time tracking, Game Over, and restart functionality  

<br>

## 💡 Key Learnings
- Gained a clear understanding of **the difference between event loops and game loops**  
- Implemented **collision detection and time-based spawn logic** between objects  
- Learned **basic graphics rendering and key event handling in Pygame**  
- Became familiar with **modular project structure using `main()` functions**  
- Experienced **team collaboration and co-development** through a group project
