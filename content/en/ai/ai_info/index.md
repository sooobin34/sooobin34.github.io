## ðŸ§  Introduction to AI Projects
This section introduces the projects completed in the **Artificial Intelligence** course at Jeonbuk National University.  
Each project focuses on implementing search algorithms and heuristic evaluation functions to enhance understanding of **game AI and problem-solving through search techniques**.

<br>

## ðŸ“‚ Project List

### **Project 1 â€“ Omok AI Based on Alpha-Beta Search**
Implemented an Omok (Gomoku) AI using the **Alpha-Beta pruning** technique and **heuristic evaluation functions**  
to enable the AI to calculate the optimal move autonomously.

### **Project 2 â€“ Solving the 8-Puzzle Problem Using Heuristic Search**
Compared and analyzed various search algorithms including **DFS, BFS, UCS, and A\***  
to develop a program that finds the optimal path to the goal state in the 8-puzzle problem.
