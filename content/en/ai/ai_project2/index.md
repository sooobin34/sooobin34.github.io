## üß© Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence course** to explore various **search algorithms** through the classic **8-puzzle problem**.  
The 8-puzzle consists of a 3√ó3 grid with numbered tiles, where the blank tile (0) can be moved up, down, left, or right to reach a goal configuration.  
We implemented and compared the performance of multiple search algorithms (DFS, BFS, UCS, and A*).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Details

### üîπ 1. Search Algorithms
- **DFS (Depth-First Search):** Stack-based search; memory-efficient but does not guarantee the optimal solution.  
- **BFS (Breadth-First Search):** Queue-based search; guarantees the shortest path but consumes more memory.  
- **UCS (Uniform Cost Search):** Considers movement cost; always finds the least-cost path.  
- **A\***: Applies a heuristic function to reach the goal efficiently with minimal cost.

<br>

### üîπ 2. Heuristic Function (for A*)
The A* search uses the **misplaced tile heuristic**,  
which counts the number of tiles that are not in their goal position.

```python
def heuristic(state, problem=None):
    misplaced = 0
    goal = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,0]]
    for row in range(3):
        for col in range(3):
            if state.cells[row][col] != 0 and state.cells[row][col] != goal[row][col]:
                misplaced += 1
    return misplaced
