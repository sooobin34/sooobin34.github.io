## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- **DBMS:** Oracle SQL Developer  
- **Language:** SQL  
- **Design:** Conceptual / Logical / Physical ERD design  
- **Normalization:** Up to Third Normal Form (3NF)

## üí° Project Outcomes
Through this project, I completed the **entire database development process**, including *requirements analysis, conceptual design, logical design, physical design,* and *implementation*.  
By designing the ERD and performing normalization, I minimized data redundancy and clarified relationships between tables, thereby improving **data integrity and management efficiency**.  
Additionally, I used **Oracle SQL Developer** to insert real data and execute queries, gaining practical experience in building a real-world database system.
